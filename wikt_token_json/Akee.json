The Merriam-Webster files contain an unattributed note that is apparently the source of this etymology: \"This seems to be the Kru word '\u0101-kee' which is used for a tree yielding an excess of sap but its exact botanical name is not certain.\" Lorenzo Turner, the African etymologist for Merriam-Webster's 3rd unabridged dictionary (1961), retained the \"Kru\" etymology but noted that he could not confirm it.
