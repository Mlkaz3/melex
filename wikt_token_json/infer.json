He is also the first to have used {it}infer{/it} in a sense close in meaning to {it}imply{/it} (1533). Both of these uses of {it}infer{/it} coexisted without comment until some time around the end of World War I. Since then, the \"indicate\" and \"hint or suggest\" meanings of {it}infer{/it} have been frequently condemned as an undesirable blurring of a useful distinction. The actual blurring has been done by the commentators. The \"indicate\" sense of {it}infer{/it}, descended from More's use of 1533, does not occur with a personal subject. When objections arose, they were to a use with a personal subject (which is now considered a use of the \"suggest, hint\" sense of {it}infer{/it}). Since dictionaries did not recognize this use specifically, the objectors assumed that the \"indicate\" sense was the one they found illogical, even though it had been in respectable use for four centuries. The actual usage condemned was a spoken one never used in logical discourse. At present the condemned \"suggest, hint\" sense is found in print chiefly in letters to the editor and other informal prose, not in serious intellectual writing. The controversy over the \"suggest, hint\" sense has apparently reduced the frequency with which the \"indicate\" sense of {it}infer{/it} is used."]]}], "syns": [{"pl": "synonyms", "pt": [["text", "{sc}infer{/sc} {sc}deduce{/sc} {sc}conclude{/sc} {sc}judge{/sc} {sc}gather{/sc} mean to arrive at a mental conclusion. {sc}infer{/sc} implies arriving at a conclusion by reasoning from evidence; if the evidence is slight, the term comes close to {it}surmise{/it}.
