The French pharmacist Nicolas Lemery (1645-1715), in the first edition of his {it}Cours de chymie{/it} (Paris, 1675, p. 2) notes the following about the word: \"{it}Chymistes{/it} have added the Arabic particle {it}al{/it} to the word {it}chymie,{/it} when they have wished to express that which is the most sublime [part of {it}chymie{/it}], such as that which teaches the transmutation of metals, although {it}alchymie{/it} signifies nothing other than {it}chymie.{/it}\" (\"Les chymistes ont ajout\u00e9 la Particle Arabe {it}Al,{/it} au mot de Chymie, quand ils ont voulu exprim\u00e9 la plus sublime, comme celle qui enseigne la Transmutation des Metaux, quoy qu'Alchemie ne signifie autre chose que la Chymie.\") This false etymologizing contributed to the later semantic separation of the two words. In a later edition of the same work (1675, pp. 60-61), Lemery took a much more negative position toward the transmutation of metals: \"Thus to work at making gold is to work in shadows, and I find that {it}alchymie{/it} has been defined very well [as follows]: {it}Ars sine arte, cuius principium mentiri, medium laborare, & finis mendicare,{/it} an Art without art, whose beginning is lying, whose middle is labor, and whose end is beggary.\" (\"Ainsi c'est proprement travailler en tenebres, que de travailler \u00e0 faire de l'or, & je trouve qu'on a fort bien d\u00e9fini l'Alchymie, {it}Ars sine arte, cuius principium mentiri, medium laborare, & finis mendicare.{/it}\") This incipient limitation of {it}alchymie{/it} to the transmutation of metals is taken up by later authors, as the English encyclopedist John Harris (ca. 1666-1719). In his {it}Lexicon Technicum{/it} (1704), under the entry {it}alchymist,{/it} Harris cites nearly verbatim Lemery's demeaning comments on {it}alchymie,{/it} while {it}chymistry{/it} is treated more neutrally: \"{sc}chymistry{/sc} is variously defined, but the design of the Art is to separate usefully the Purer Parts of any mix'd body from the more gross and impure.\" In the influental {it}Encyclop\u00e9die{/it} of Denis Diderot and contributors the separation between alchemy and chemistry is even clearer: \"{it}Chemistry{/it} is a science that is concerned with the separation and union of the principles making up bodies, whether operated upon by nature or by art, with the view of discovering the characteristics of these bodies, or of making them suitable for various uses.\" (\"La {it}Chimie{/it} est une science qui s'occupe des s\u00e9parations & des unions des principes constituans des corps, soit op\u00e9r\u00e9es par la nature, soit op\u00e9r\u00e9es par l'art, dans la v\u00fbe de d\u00e9couvrir les qualit\u00e9s de ces corps, ou de les rendre propres \u00e0 divers usages\" - vol. 3, 1753, p. 417; the {it}chimie{/it} article written by Gabriel-Fran\u00e7ois Venel.) Alchemy, on the other hand, is characterized as essentially \"the art of transmuting metals\" (\"l'art de transmuer les m\u00e9taux,\" p. 425). For a detailed discussion, see William R. Newman and Lawrence M. Principe, \"Alchemy vs. Chemistry: the Etymological Origins of a Historiographic Mistake,\" {it}Early Science and Medicine,{/it} vol. 3, no. 1 (1998), pp. 32-65. The authors advocate using the term {it}chymistry{/it} to describe alchemy/chemistry as it was practiced in the early modern period."]]]], "date": "1559{ds||1|a|}", "shortdef": ["alchemist", "one trained in chemistry", "pharmacist"]}, {"meta": {"id": "chemist's shop", "uuid": "d2241ed8-a212-4a4b-a241-057b0a789657", "sort": "3003164000", "src": "ld", "section": "idioms", "stems": ["chemist's shop"], "offensive": false}, "hwi": {"hw": "chemist's shop"}, "fl": "noun", "def": [{"sls": ["British"], "sseq": [[["sense", {"dt": [["text", "{bc}a store that sells medicines and various other products (such as newspapers, candy, soap, etc.)"]]}]]]}], "shortdef": ["a store that sells medicines and various other products (such as newspapers, candy, soap, etc.)"]}]
