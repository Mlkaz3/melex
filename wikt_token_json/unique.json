Objections are based chiefly on the assumption that {it}unique{/it} has but a single absolute sense, an assumption contradicted by information readily available in a dictionary. {it}Unique{/it} dates back to the 17th century but was little used until the end of the 18th when, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it was reacquired from French. H. J. Todd entered it as a foreign word in his edition (1818) of Johnson's Dictionary, characterizing it as \"affected and useless.\" Around the middle of the 19th century it ceased to be considered foreign and came into considerable popular use. With popular use came a broadening of application beyond the original two meanings (here numbered senses 1 and 2a). In modern use both comparison and modification are widespread and standard but are confined to the extended senses 2b and 3. When sense 1 or sense 2a is intended, {it}unique{/it} is used without qualifying modifiers."]]}], "syns": [{"pl": "synonyms", "pt": [["text", "{sc}strange{/sc} {sc}singular{/sc} {sc}unique{/sc} {sc}peculiar{/sc} {sc}eccentric{/sc} {sc}erratic{/sc} {sc}odd{/sc} {sc}quaint{/sc} {sc}outlandish{/sc} mean departing from what is ordinary, usual, or to be expected. {sc}strange{/sc} stresses unfamiliarity and may apply to the foreign, the unnatural, the unaccountable.
