The words {it}econometric, econometrics,{/it} etc., are all dependent on French {it}\u00e9conom\u00e9trie,{/it} which was introduced by Ragnar Frisch in the paper {ldquo}Sur un probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9conomie pure,{rdquo} {it}Norsk Matematisk Forenings skrifter,{/it} series I, no. 16 (1926), pp. 1-40. The French word was translated into English as {it}econometry{/it} in a review of the paper published in 1927 ({it}Journal of the Royal Statistical Society,{/it} vol. 90, no. 1, pp. 146-47). Curiously, the word {it}econometry{/it} appeared earlier, apparently in a nonce usage, in A.R. Crathorne, {ldquo}The Course in Statistics in the Mathematics Department,{rdquo} {it}American Mathematical Monthly,{/it} vol. 33, no. 4, April, 1926, p. 186 ({ldquo}Biologists and anthropologists have long recognized the principle implied here and have invented the words biometry and anthropometry. We might ask the economists to introduce the word econometry, but it would be very difficult to argue them out of their rather well grounded historical claim to some share in the word statistics.{rdquo}). Still earlier, the German word {it}Oekonometrie{/it} was apparently coined\u2014though in a much more restricted sense\u2014by the Polish banker and economist Pawe\u0142 Ciompa ({it}Grundrisse einer Oekonometrie und die auf der Nationalo\u0308konomie aufgebaute natu\u0308rliche Theorie der Buchhaltung,{/it} Lemberg [Lw\u00f3w/L'viv], 1910), though Ragnar Frisch was not aware of Ciompa's word (see Frisch, {ldquo}Note on the Term 'Econometrics',{rdquo} {it}Econometrica,{/it} vol. 4, issue 1 [January, 1936], p. 95). As a product of word formation, {it}econometrics/econometry{/it} (and their French and German predecessors) can be regarded as either a blend (as indicated above) or as a truncation of {it}economy,{/it} with the second {it}-o-{/it} unetymologically taken as the combining vowel."]]]], "date": "1931", "shortdef": ["the application of statistical methods to the study of economic data and problems"]}]
