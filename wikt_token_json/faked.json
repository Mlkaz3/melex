In James Hardy Vaux's \"A New and Comprehensive Vocabulary of the Flash Language\" (vol. 2 of Hardy's {it}Memoirs,{/it} London, 1819), it receives a very general definition: \"a word so variously used, that I can only illustrate it by a few examples. To fake any person or place, may signify to rob them; to fake a person, may also imply to shoot, wound, or cut; to fake a man out and out, is to kill him; a man who inflicts wounds upon, or otherwise disfigures, himself, for any sinister purpose, is said to have faked himself \u2026 to fake a screeve, is to write a letter, or other paper; to fake a screw, is to shape out a skeleton or false key, for the purpose of screwing a particular place; to fake a cly, is to pick a pocket; etc., etc., etc.\" (p. 170). However, Hardy also records {it}bit-faking{/it} \"coining base money\" and both Vaux and the earlier {it}Lexicon Balatronicum{/it} (London, 1811, a revision of Francis Grose's {it}Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue,{/it} 1785) record {it}fakement{/it} in the sense \"forgery.\" so the sense \"to simulate, counterfeit\" was perhaps part of its original meaning. Much earlier is the agent noun {it}faker,{/it} defined as \"maker\" in a list of \"Canting Terms used by Beggars, Vagabonds, Cheaters, Cripples and Bedlams.\" in Randle Holme's {it}The Academy of Armory{/it} (Chester, 1688) (a book about heraldry that includes a miscellany of information having nothing to do with heraldry). Along with {it}faker{/it} Holme lists {it}Ben-Fakers,{/it} \"Counterfeiters of Passes and Seals\" ({it}ben{/it} is defined as \"good\"). This expression occurs earlier as {it}ben-feaker{/it} in Thomas Dekker's pamphlet on cant, {it}O per se O. Or A new cryer of Lanthorne and candle-light{/it} (London, 1612): \"Of Ben-feakers of Jybes \u2026They who are Counterfeiters of Passeports, are called Ben-feakers , that is to say, Good-Makers.\" (It is possible that Holme simply copied his entries from Dekker.) The noun {it}feaker/faker{/it} implies a corresponding verb {it}feak/fake{/it} \"make,\" for which there appears to be no certain evidence. There is {it}feague, fegue{/it} \"to beat, whip\" (earliest in the compound {it}bumfeage{/it}) and \"to wear out, bring about the ruin of,\" which are colloquial\u2014the second sense is only attested in Restoration drama\u2014but not argot, and which have a voiced velar consonant (aside from a single occurrence of a participle {it}feakt{/it}). A suggestion dating back to Nathan Bailey's {it}An Universal Etymological English Dictionary{/it} (4th edition, 1728) is that this word is borrowed from Dutch {it}vegen{/it} \"to sweep\"; compare also German {it}fegen{/it} \"to wipe, clean, sweep.\" For further discussion see Anatoly Liberman, \"A fake etymology of the word fake,\" {it}OUPblog,{/it} August 23, 2017."]]]], "date": "1819{ds|t|1||}", "shortdef": ["to alter, manipulate, or treat so as to give a spuriously genuine appearance to : doctor", "counterfeit, simulate, concoct", "to deceive (an opponent) in a sports contest by means of a fake"]}, {"meta": {"id": "fake:5", "uuid": "1a3d7cc8-917c-4153-a245-f377c9253365", "sort": "060196000", "src": "collegiate", "section": "alpha", "stems": ["fake", "faked", "fakes", "faking"], "offensive": false}, "hom": 5, "hwi": {"hw": "fake"}, "fl": "verb", "ins": [{"if": "faked"}, {"if": "fak*ing"}], "def": [{"vd": "transitive verb", "sseq": [[["sense", {"dt": [["text", "{bc}to coil in fakes"]]}]]]}], "et": [["text", "Middle English {it}faken,{/it} of obscure origin"]], "date": "15th century", "shortdef": ["to coil in fakes"]}, {"meta": {"id": "fake out", "uuid": "f4b8272d-8e6f-42f5-91ec-6126ee24c130", "sort": "060197000", "src": "collegiate", "section": "alpha", "stems": ["fake out", "faked out", "fakes out", "faking out"], "offensive": false}, "hwi": {"hw": "fake out"}, "fl": "verb", "ins": [{"if": "faked out"}, {"if": "fak*ing out"}, {"if": "fakes out"}], "def": [{"vd": "transitive verb", "sseq": [[["sense", {"dt": [["text", "{bc}to deliberately mislead {bc}{sx|fool||}, {sx|trick||}"]]}]]]}], "date": "1949", "shortdef": ["to deliberately mislead : fool, trick"]}, {"meta": {"id": "pump fake", "uuid": "3b07d4b4-309e-4c4f-bd0a-a8e4bbaec834", "sort": "168681000", "src": "collegiate", "section": "alpha", "stems": ["pump fake", "pump fakes", "pump-fake", "pump-faked", "pump-fakes", "pump-faking"], "offensive": false}, "hwi": {"hw": "pump fake"}, "fl": "noun", "def": [{"sseq": [[["sense", {"dt": [["text", "{bc}a fake in which a player simulates throwing a pass (as in football) or taking a shot (as in basketball)"]]}]]]}], "uros": [{"ure": "pump-fake", "prs": [{"mw": "\u02c8p\u0259mp-\u02ccf\u0101k", "sound": {"audio": "pump-fake_1", "ref": "owl", "stat": "1"}}], "fl": "verb"}], "date": "1964", "shortdef": ["a fake in which a player simulates throwing a pass (as in football) or taking a shot (as in basketball)"]}, {"meta": {"id": "up-fake", "uuid": "e8bbc050-0352-4234-8d07-1359f28d1722", "sort": "212392000", "src": "collegiate", "section": "alpha", "stems": ["up-fake", "up-faked", "up-fakes", "up-faking"], "offensive": false}, "hwi": {"hw": "up-fake", "prs": [{"mw": "\u02c8\u0259p-\u02c8f\u0101k", "sound": {"audio": "up-fake_1", "ref": "owl", "stat": "1"}}]}, "fl": "noun", "def": [{"sseq": [[["sense", {"dt": [["text", "{bc}a fake in which a player makes an upward movement to simulate starting to take a shot "], ["vis", [{"t": "\u2026 senior guard Natalie Ventress had the Mustangs fooled with a nice {wi}up-fake{/wi} and right-handed layup finish.", "aq": {"auth": "Hayes Clement"}}]]]}]]]}], "uros": [{"ure": "up-fake", "fl": "verb, transitive + intransitive", "utxt": [["vis", [{"t": "Leonard later bulled his way by James to the rim, {wi}up-faked{/wi} and then made a floating jumper over the Cavaliers forward.", "aq": {"source": "{it}The Lewiston (Idaho) Morning Tribune{/it}"}}]]]}], "date": "1982", "shortdef": ["a fake in which a player makes an upward movement to simulate starting to take a shot"]}]
