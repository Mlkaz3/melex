Usage Guide", "pt": [["text", "The words {it}sex{/it} and {it}gender{/it} have a long and intertwined history. In the 15th century {it}gender{/it} expanded from its use as a term for a grammatical subclass to join {it}sex{/it} in referring to either of the two primary biological forms of a species, a meaning {it}sex{/it} has had since the 14th century; phrases like {ldquo}the male sex{rdquo} and {ldquo}the female gender{rdquo} are both grounded in uses established for more than five centuries. In the 20th century {it}sex{/it} and {it}gender{/it} each acquired new uses. {it}Sex{/it} developed its {ldquo}sexual intercourse{rdquo} meaning in the early part of the century (now its more common meaning), and a few decades later {it}gender{/it} gained a meaning referring to the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex, as in {ldquo}gender roles.{rdquo} Later in the century, {it}gender{/it} also came to have application in two closely related compound terms: {d_link|gender identity|gender identity} refers to a person's internal sense of being male, female, some combination of male and female, or neither male nor female; {d_link|gender expression|gender expression} refers to the physical and behavioral manifestations of one's gender identity. By the end of the century {it}gender{/it} by itself was being used as a synonym of {it}gender identity{/it}.{p_br}Among those who study gender and sexuality, a clear delineation between {it}sex{/it} and {it}gender{/it} is typically prescribed, with {it}sex{/it} as the preferred term for biological forms, and {it}gender{/it} limited to its meanings involving behavioral, cultural, and psychological traits. In this dichotomy, the terms {d_link|male|male:1} and {d_link|female|female:1} relate only to biological forms ({it}sex{/it}), while the terms {d_link|masculine|masculine:1}/{d_link|masculinity|masculinity}, {d_link|feminine|feminine:1}/{d_link|femininity|femininity}, {d_link|woman|woman}/{d_link|girl|girl}, and {d_link|man|man:1}/{d_link|boy|boy} relate only to psychological and sociocultural traits ({it}gender{/it}). This delineation also tends to be observed in technical and medical contexts, with the term {it}sex{/it} referring to biological forms in such phrases as {it}sex hormones{/it}, {it}sex organs{/it}, and {it}biological sex{/it}. But in nonmedical and nontechnical contexts, there is no clear delineation, and the status of the words remains complicated. Often when comparisons explicitly between male and female people are made, we see the term {it}gender{/it} employed, with that term dominating in such collocations as {it}gender differences{/it}, {it}gender gap{/it}, {it}gender equality{/it}, {it}gender bias{/it}, and {it}gender relations{/it}. It is likely that {it}gender{/it} is applied in such contexts because of its psychological and sociocultural meanings, the word's duality making it dually useful. The fact remains that it is often applied in such cases against the prescribed use.{p_br}Usage of {it}sex{/it} and {it}gender{/it} is by no means settled. For example, while {it}discrimination{/it} was far more often paired with {it}sex{/it} from the 1960s through the 20th century and into the 21st, the phrase {it}gender discrimination{/it} has been steadily increasing in use since the 1980s and is on track to become the dominant collocation. Currently both terms are sometimes employed with their intended synonymy made explicit: {it}sex/gender discrimination{/it}, {it}gender (sex) discrimination{/it}."]]}], "et": [["text", "Middle English {it}gendre{/it}, from Anglo-French {it}genre, gendre{/it}, from Latin {it}gener-, genus{/it} birth, race, kind, gender {ma}{mat|kin|}{/ma}"]], "date": "14th century{ds||1|a|}", "shortdef": ["a subclass within a grammatical class (such as noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb) of a language that is partly arbitrary but also partly based on distinguishable characteristics (such as shape, social rank, manner of existence, or sex) and that determines agreement with and selection of other words or grammatical forms", "membership of a word or a grammatical form in such a subclass", "an inflectional form showing membership in such a subclass"]}, {"meta": {"id": "gender:2", "uuid": "5c190829-0d71-4fe9-ac22-1ef4a337c553", "sort": "070682000", "src": "collegiate", "section": "alpha", "stems": ["gender", "gendered", "gendering", "genders"], "offensive": false}, "hom": 2, "hwi": {"hw": "gender"}, "fl": "verb", "ins": [{"if": "gen*dered"}, {"if": "gen*der*ing", "prs": [{"mw": "\u02c8jen-d(\u0259-)ri\u014b", "sound": {"audio": "gender02", "ref": "c", "stat": "1"}}]}], "def": [{"sseq": [[["sense", {"dt": [["text", "{bc}{sx|engender||}"]]}]]]}], "et": [["text", "Middle English {it}gendren{/it}, from Anglo-French {it}gendrer{/it}, from Latin {it}generare{/it} {ma}{mat|generate|}{/ma}"]], "date": "14th century", "shortdef": ["engender"]}, {"meta": {"id": "gender bender", "uuid": "9951d3d2-b7f2-4fe2-aaa3-bff5b2e7cd83", "sort": "070683000", "src": "collegiate", "section": "alpha", "stems": ["gender bender", "gender benders", "gender-bending", "gender-bendings"], "offensive": false}, "hwi": {"hw": "gender bender"}, "fl": "noun", "def": [{"sseq": [[["sense", {"dt": [["text", "{bc}a person who dresses and behaves like a member of the opposite sex"]]}]]]}], "uros": [{"ure": "gen*der-bend*ing", "prs": [{"mw": "\u02c8jen-d\u0259r-\u02c8ben-di\u014b", "sound": {"audio": "gender-bending_1", "ref": "owl", "stat": "1"}}], "fl": "adjective or noun"}], "date": "1975", "shortdef": ["a person who dresses and behaves like a member of the opposite sex"]}, {"meta": {"id": "gender confirmation surgery", "uuid": "d7c1643b-50d0-4a1d-aaac-c5fb09fa9626", "sort": "070683250", "src": "collegiate", "section": "alpha", "stems": ["gender confirmation surgeries", "gender confirmation surgery"], "offensive": false}, "hwi": {"hw": "gender confirmation surgery"}, "fl": "noun", "def": [{"sseq": [[["sense", {"dt": [["text", "{bc}any of several surgical procedures that a transgender person may choose to undergo in order to obtain the physical characteristics that match their {d_link|gender identity|gender identity} "], ["vis", [{"t": "A new study has confirmed what others before it have found: {wi}Gender confirmation surgery{/wi} improves the quality of life of most who choose to undergo it.", "aq": {"auth": "Jeff Taylor"}}, {"t": "{wi}Gender confirmation surgeries{/wi} for trans men and trans women, respectively, differ in scope and kind, giving patients a range of medical options to define transitioning on their own terms.", "aq": {"auth": "Lydia Dishman"}}]]]}]]]}], "date": "1993", "shortdef": ["any of several surgical procedures that a transgender person may choose to undergo in order to obtain the physical characteristics that match their gender identity"]}, {"meta": {"id": "gender dysphoria", "uuid": "28b60bca-cd62-4107-beb7-0de106422122", "sort": "070683500", "src": "collegiate", "section": "alpha", "stems": ["gender dysphoria", "gender dysphorias"], "offensive": false}, "hwi": {"hw": "gender dysphoria"}, "fl": "noun", "def": [{"sseq": [[["sense", {"dt": [["text", "{bc}a distressed state arising from conflict between a person's {d_link|gender identity|gender identity} and the sex the person has or was identified as having at birth"]], "sdsense": {"sd": "also", "dt": [["text", "{bc}a condition marked by such distress"]]}}]]]}], "date": "1973", "shortdef": ["a distressed state arising from conflict between a person's gender identity and the sex the person has or was identified as having at birth;
