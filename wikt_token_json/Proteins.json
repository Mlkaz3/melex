Though Mulder in the beginning of the papers expresses gratitude to J\u00f6ns Jakob {et_link|berzelius|Berzelius:b} for his support, he does not mention any connection between Berzelius and the novel word. In the twentieth century, however, it was discovered that Berzelius had suggested the word to Mulder in a letter written July 10, 1838: \"Le nom prot\u00e9ine que je vous propose pour l'oxyde organique de la fibrine et de l'albumine, je voulais le d\u00e9river de \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, parce qu'il para\u00eet \u00eatre la substance primitive ou principale de la nutrition animale que les plantes pr\u00e9parent pour les herbivores et que ceux-ci fournissent ensuite aux carnassiers.\" (\"The name protein, which I propose for the organic oxide of fibrin and albumin, I wish to derive from {it}pr\u014dteios,{/it} because it appears to be the primitive or principal substance of animal nutrition, which plants prepare for herbivores, and which the latter then provide for carnivores.\" \u2014 quoted in H.B. Vickery, \"The origin of the word protein,\" {it}Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine,{/it} vol. 22, no. 5 [May, 1950], pp. 387-93.) In the French article, Mulder glosses the word {it}pr\u014dte\u00eeos{/it} with Latin {it}primarius{/it} \"primary\": \"The organic material, being a general principal of all the constituent parts of the animal body and being found, as we will see later, in the vegetable kingdom, could be named protein from pr\u014dte\u00eeos \u2026\" (La mati\u00e8re organique, \u00e9tant un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de toutes les parties constituantes du corps animal, et se trouvant, comme nous verrons tant\u00f4t, dans le r\u00e8gne v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, pourrait se nommer Prot\u00e9ine de \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 primarius.\") This appears to be Mulder's own interpretation of the Greek word, as the leading Greek dictionary of the time, Franz Passow's {it}Handw\u00f6rterbuch der griechischen Sprache{/it} (4.
