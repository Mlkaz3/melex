Rix hypothesizes that between about 700 {sc}b.c.{/sc} and 450 {sc}b.c.{/sc}, as most transhumant shepherds in the Italian peninsula came to be slaves, an agent noun meaning \"flock guard\" developed a secondary sense \"slave,\" and by the time of the earliest Latin texts had largely lost its original meaning (with {it}p\u0101stor{/it} becoming the usual word for a shepherd\u2014see {et_link|pastor:1|pastor:1}). The presumption is that Italic languages\u2014as Indo-European languages generally\u2014lacked a word for \"slave,\" as slavery was an institution endemic to older Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilizations.
