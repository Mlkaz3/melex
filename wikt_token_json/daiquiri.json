Mines developed by the company were located in the mountains several miles north of Daiquir\u00ed. An early attribution of the drink to Cox is by the journalist and fiction writer Richard Harding Davis (\"Breaking into the Movies,\" {it}Scribner's Magazine,{/it} vol. 55, no. 3, March, 1914, p. 284): \"And for our immedate needs there were \u2026 at disturbingly frequent intervals trays loaded with the insidious Daiquiri cocktail. This latter is the creation of the late Jennings S. Cox, for some time manager of the iron mines, and it is as genial and as brimful of brotherly love as was the man who invented it. It consists of Barcardi [sic] rum, limes, sugar and cracked ice \u2026.\" The papers and photographs of the Cuban socialite Carmen Puig, part of the Cuban Heritage Collection of the University of Miami Library, contain a handwritten recipe for the drink purporting to be Cox's original (see scanned view at the library's Digital Collections website)."]]]], "date": "1920", "shortdef": ["an alcoholic drink that is usually made of rum, crushed fruit or fruit juice, and sugar"]}]
