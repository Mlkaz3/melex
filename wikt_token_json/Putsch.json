The word may have been popularized in Germany by the Swiss author Gottfried Keller, who used it in an oft-quoted passage in his novel {it}Der gr\u00fcne Heinrich{/it} (\"Green Henry,\" 1855): \"Das Wort Putsch stammt aus der guten Stadt Z\u00fcrich, wo man einen pl\u00f6tzlichen vor\u00fcbergehenden Regenguss einen Putsch nennt und demgem\u00e4ss die eifers\u00fcchtigen Nachbarst\u00e4dte jede n\u00e4rrische Gem\u00fctsbewegung, Begeisterung, Zornigkeit, Laune oder Mode der Z\u00fcricher einen Z\u00fcrichputsch nennen.\" (\"The word Putsch originates in the good city of Z\u00fcrich, where people call a sudden passing downpour a Putsch, and accordingly the jealous neighboring cities give the name 'Z\u00fcrich Putsch' [Swiss German {it}Z\u00fcriputsch{/it}] to every foolish emotional display, inspiration, burst of anger, mood or fashion of the Z\u00fcrich natives.\") Keller's usage has no connection to politics, however, and in any case, as the {it}Schweizerisches Idiotikon{/it} notes, he appears to have confused {it}Putsch{/it} with {it}Gutsch{/it} (also {it}Gutz, G\u00fctsch{/it}) \"torrent, overflow of a liquid.\""]]]], "date": "1919", "shortdef": ["a secretly plotted and suddenly executed attempt to overthrow a government"]}]
