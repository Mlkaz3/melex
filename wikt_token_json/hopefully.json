A surge of criticism followed in reaction, but the criticism took no account of the grammar of adverbs. {it}Hopefully{/it} when used to mean \"it is hoped\" is a member of a class of adverbs known as disjuncts. Disjuncts serve as a means by which the author or speaker can comment directly to the reader or hearer usually on the content of the sentence to which they are attached. Many other adverbs (such as {it}interestingly, frankly, clearly, luckily, unfortunately{/it}) are similarly used; most are so ordinary as to excite no comment or interest whatsoever.
