A traditional explanation derives it from a base {it}*pel-d-,{/it} with the {it}*-d-{/it} a present-tense formative marking an action reaching a definite termination (thus Ernout and Meillet in {it}Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique de la langue latine,{/it} 8. \u00e9dition, 1985; cf. {et_link|tender:3|tender:3}). A hypothetically related form would be Greek {it}p\u00e1ll\u014d, p\u00e1llein{/it} \"to poise (a missile before it is thrown), brandish, swing, shake\" (Epic aorist {it}p\u00ealai,{/it} 3rd singular passive {it}p\u00e1lto{/it}), though semantically the comparison is weak. A base {it}*pel-d-{/it} would correctly produce the past participle {it}pulsus{/it} (from {it}*poltos{/it} < {it}*pl\u0325d-t-os{/it}); however the frequentative verb {it}pult\u0101re{/it} \"to strike repeatedly,\" attested in Plautus alongside {it}puls\u0101re,{/it} suggests that the original past participle may have been {it}*pultus.{/it} According to an alternative hypothesis, {it}pellere{/it} is descended from an Indo-European base {it}*pelh{inf}2{/inf}-{/it} \"approach, draw near,\" seen in Greek {it}p\u00edlnamai{/it} \"I draw near to, make contact with,\" 3rd singular aorist {it}pl\u00eato,{/it} verbal adjective in the negated form {it}\u00e1pl\u0113tos, \u00e1pl\u0101tos{/it} \"unapproachable, monstrous.\" (The assumed semantic shift is from \"approach, touch\" to \"push, strike.\") Both Latin and Greek verbs would continue a present with nasal infix {it}*pl\u0325-ne-h{inf}2{/inf}-/pl\u0325n-h{inf}2{/inf}-.{/it} These presumably are seen also in Umbrian {it}ampentu, apentu, ampetu,{/it} 3rd singular imperative (allegedly \"touches, brings near,\" with the prefix {it}an-{/it} \"up, upon,\" but the meaning of this verb, describing the first action of an animal sacrifice in the Iguvine Tables, is quite uncertain); Old Irish {it}\u02d1ella{/it} in {it}ad\u02d1ella{/it} \"(s/he) visits, approaches,\" {it}do\u02d1ella{/it} \"(s/he) turns aside, goes astray\" (< {it}*\u03c6al-na-{/it}?; e-vocalism is secondary) and {it}eblaid{/it} \"(s/he) will drive/impel,\" suppletive future to {it}aigid{/it} \"(s/he) drives\" (< {it}*pi-pl\u0101-{/it}); Middle Welsh {it}el,{/it} 3rd person singular present subjunctive of {it}mynet{/it} \"to go\" (< {it}*pel-ase/o-{/it}). Note that alongside {it}pellere{/it} there is a group of first-conjugation verbs with the same base {it}pell-{/it} that occur only with prefixes: {it}appell\u0101re{/it} \"to speak to, address, name,\" {it}compell\u0101re{/it} \"to address, appeal to, rebuke,\" {it}interpell\u0101re{/it} \"to interrupt\" (see {et_link|appeal:2|appeal:2}, {et_link|compellation|compellation}, {et_link|interpellate|interpellate}). According to P. Schrijver ({it}The Reflexes of the Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals in Latin,{/it} Rodopi, 1991, pp. 408-12), these are a relic of an original nasal present {it}*pel-n-a-C{/it} (< {it}*pl\u0325-ne-h{inf}2{/inf}-{/it} with full-grade vocalism) given a thematic suffix {it}*-i\u032fe/o-{/it} in derivatives. These verbs have the common underlying sense \"to address (positively or negatively),\" which fits fairly well with the hypothetical meaning \"approach\" of the base {it}*pelh{inf}2{/inf}-.{/it} For English borrowings of prefixed forms of {it}pellere{/it} see {et_link|compel|compel}, {et_link|dispel|dispel}, {et_link|expel|expel}, {et_link|impel|impel}, {et_link|propel|propel}, {et_link|repel|repel}."]]]], "date": "14th century{ds||1|a|}", "shortdef": ["the regular expansion of an artery caused by the ejection of blood into the arterial system by the contractions of the heart", "the palpable beat resulting from such pulse as detected in a superficial artery;
