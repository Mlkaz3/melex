Middle English spellings such as {it}douve,{/it} however, would seem to require an Old English long vowel, as do the Germanic cognates. These issues were pointed out by E. J. Dobson ({it}English Pronunciation, 1500-1700,{/it} 2. edition, Oxford, 1968, p. 514), who follows the {it}Oxford English Dictionary{/it}'s suggestion that the noun is related to Old English {it}d\u016bfan{/it} \"to dive, plunge (into a liquid)\" (see {et_link|dive:1|dive:1}) and that the forms with long and short {it}u{/it} reflect different ablaut grades of {it}d\u016bfan{/it} (a class II strong verb). Essentially the same solution, without the discussion of the English details, is proposed by G. Kroonen ({it}Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic,{/it} Brill, 2013). The difficulty with this hypothesis is that the noun in Germanic languages uniformly means \"dove, pigeon,\" not an aquatic bird.
