It has been assumed that the initial {it}col-/gol-{/it} of the Latin and Slavic words describes a color, presumably a shade of blue, and that {it}-b-{/it} continues an Indo-European suffix {it}*-b{sup}h{/sup}o-{/it} of color and animal names. W.B. Lockwood (\"Latin {it}columba, palumb\u0113s,{/it} Greek {it}\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2,{/it}\" {it}Historische Sprachforschung,{/it} Band 103 [1990], pp. 261-63) compares Greek {it}ell\u00f3s, hell\u00f3s{/it} \"young deer, fawn\" (from {it}*eln\u00f3s{/it}) beside {it}\u00e9laphos{/it} \"red deer ({it}Cervus elaphus{/it}),\" but as the base here is probably an original n-stem {it}*h{inf}1{/inf}el-en-{/it} with evidence in a number of other Indo-European languages (see {et_link|elk|elk}), the internal vowel-nasal sequence in {it}columba{/it} and {it}gol\u01ebb\u012d{/it} is not really accounted for. The Slavic words have been compared with Lithuanian {it}gelumb\u0117\u0303{/it}\u0303 \"rather thick machine-made woolen fabric\" (originally dove-colored, i.e., blue or blue-gray?) and less likely with {it}gul\u0303b\u0117{/it} \"swan,\" though these hardly illuminate. (Old Prussian {it}golimban{/it} \"blue\" may be a loan from Slavic.) Lockwood (op. cit.) rejects the relevance of Greek {it}k\u00f3lymbos{/it} on the grounds that names for the grebe in languages generally are based on their diving habits, not on color words. The resemblance of {it}k\u00f3lymbos{/it} to the Latin and Slavic words is nevertheless inescapable, and the presence of {it}-b-{/it} rather {it}-ph-{/it} in the putative suffix would rule out any connection with Indo-European {it}*-b{sup}h{/sup}o-.{/it} R. Beekes ({it}Etymological Dictionary of Greek,{/it} Brill, 2009), based on the variants {it}kol\u00fdmbaina/kol\u00fdbdaina{/it} as the name for a kind of crab, believes the word is of pre-Greek substratal origin. If, pace Lockwood, {it}k\u00f3lybos{/it} is of any relevance to {it}columba{/it} and {it}gol\u01ebb\u012d,{/it} a European substratum might be behind all three."]]]], "date": "14th century", "shortdef": ["any of a genus (Aquilegia) of plants of the buttercup family with irregular showy spurred flowers: such as", "a red-flowered plant (A. canadensis) of eastern North America", "a blue-flowered plant (A. caerulea) of the Rocky Mountains"]}]
